Outfit Highlighter

Makes the selected outfit stand out more in the outfitter screen. Recommended for those who prefer to navigate the outfitter using the keyboard instead of the mouse.

Now includes alternate themed highlighters! To change highlighters, copy the image file in the subfolder for your chosen theme and paste it into the ui folder of the Outfit Highlighter plugin. (Not the Endless Sky ui folder!)
